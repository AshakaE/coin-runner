Coin runner

An endless runner game, where a player hops from platform to platform collecting coins for as long as:
- The player does not fall off the platform.
- The player does not enter the flames.

--- Movement
The player can only jump two times.
Press the 'W' key twice to double jump.

-- Scores
The player can increase his score by collecting coins.

--- Game Over
The total number of coins collected.
An Input field to collect player names and save the player score.

-- Future additions

In the future, I will try to add more coins with varying values.
I will also try to add game speed to increase difficulty.
